# E08b-Debugging

This is an exercise for a C220 Game Technology class at Indiana University. The exercise is built to help students practice debugging in Godot on GDScript. The bugs include syntax, interpreter, and other runtime errors in a game project. There were originally 8 errors which had to be fixed 

This exercise was adapted from the excellent platformer tutorial developed by GDQuest. The game seems to be running properly. I forgot to make notes for myself while going through it, so I tried to go back at the end to find all of my changes but was only able to locate 6/8. The game works, but I don't know whether or not I fixed all of the bugs.  

The project is associated with a tutorial (both a free and paid version). The free version is in two parts and is available here:
 * [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot: Player and Enemy (beginner tutorial part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk)
 * [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot: Coins, Portals, and Levels (beginner tutorial part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ziIyx60N6I)

The original source code is available on GitHub.
